# Cat-Dog Classifier
The app classifies the images of Cats and Dogs. The user can upload an already existing picture or can capture during the runtime.
The app uses a Deep learning model which is trained on a Tensorflow dataset of cats and dogs.
The model is trained through Transfer learning using the Mobile Net model. The accuracy of the model is 98-99%.
